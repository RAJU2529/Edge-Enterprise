# Release notes for Microsoft Edge Beta Channel

These release notes provide information about new features and non-security updates that are included in the Microsoft Edge Beta Channel. Archived versions of these release notes are available [here](microsoft-edge-relnote-archive-beta-channel.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Edge Web Platform constantly evolves to improve user experience, security, and privacy. To learn more, see [Site compatibility-impacting changes coming to Microsoft Edge](/microsoft-edge/web-platform/site-impacting-changes).

## Version 92.0.902.22: June 21

### Feature updates

- **Users can easily get to Internet Explorer mode on Microsoft Edge**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 92, users can reload a site in Internet Explorer mode on Microsoft Edge instead of relying on the standalone IE 11 application while waiting for a site to be configured in the Enterprise Mode Site List. Users will be prompted to add the site to their local site list such that navigating to the same page in Microsoft Edge will automatically render in IE mode for the next 30 days. You can use the *[InternetExplorerIntegrationReloadInIEModeAllowed](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#internetexplorerintegrationreloadiniemodeallowed)* policy to configure this experience and allow access to the IE mode entry points as well as the ability to add sites to the local site list. You can use the *[InternetExplorerIntegrationLocalSiteListExpirationDays](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#internetexplorerintegrationlocalsitelistexpirationdays)* policy to adjust the number of days to keep sites on the local site list.
Note that KB5003698 or later is required for Windows 10, version 1909; or KB5003690 or later is required for Windows 10, version 2004, Windows 10, version 20H2, or Windows 10, version 21H1 for the end-to-end experience.

- **MHTML files will default to opening in Internet Explorer mode**. Starting in Microsoft Edge version 92 Stable, MHTML file types will automatically open in Internet Explorer mode on Microsoft Edge instead of the Internet Explorer (IE11) application. This is most commonly observed while trying to view Outlook emails in a browser. This change will occur only if IE11 is the default handler for this file type. If you'd prefer to change this, you can do so prior to installing the Stable version 92 update using [this guidance](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-applicationdefaults#applicationdefaults-defaultassociationsconfiguration).

- **Payment instruments are now synced across devices**. Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 92, you have the option to synchronize your payment information across your signed in devices.
Please note: this is a Controlled Feature Rollout and we are currently at 50%. If you don’t see this feature, please check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

- **"Disable developer mode extensions" warning can be permanently dismissed**. Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 92, you can turn off the warning "Disable developer mode extensions" by clicking on the 'Don't show this again' option.
Please note: this is a Controlled Feature Rollout and we are currently at 25%. If you don’t see this feature, please check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

- **Manage your extensions right from the toolbar**. The all-new extensions menu on the toolbar will allow you to hide/pin extensions easily. The quick links to manage extensions and find new extensions will make it easy for you to find new extensions and manage your existing ones.
Please note: this is a Controlled Feature Rollout and we are currently at 25%. If you don’t see this feature, please check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

- **Automatic HTTPS**. Users will have the option to upgrade navigation from HTTP to HTTPS on domains likely to support this more secure protocol. This support can also be configured to attempt delivery over HTTPS for all domains.
Please note: we are experimenting with this feature and this behavior won’t be seen if you have opted out of experiments.

- **Improvements to font rendering**. Improvements have been made to the rendering of text to improve clarity and reduce blurriness.
Please note: this is a Controlled Feature Rollout and we are currently at 25%. If you don’t see this feature, please check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

### Feature updates

- **Identify network traffic originating from Microsoft Defender Application Guard containers at the proxy level**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91, there’s built in support to tag network traffic originating from Application Guard containers, allowing enterprises to identify them and apply specific policies.

- **Support option to allow synchronizing Favorites from the host to the Edge Application Guard container**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91, users have the option to configure Application Guard to synchronize their favorites from the host to the container. This ensures new favorites appear on the container as well.

- **Support for Speech Recognition APIs**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91, API support for speech recognition commands on Google.com and similar sites will be added. This feature is limited to a randomly selected group of users who have enabled experimentation. These users are giving feedback to the feature team.

- **Personalize your browser with new theme colors**. Make Microsoft Edge your own with one of the fourteen new theme colors on the Settings -> Appearance page. You can also install custom themes from the Microsoft Edge Add-on site. [Learn more](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/make-microsoft-edge-your-own-with-themes/m-p/2083165)

- **Interrupt Downloads** Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91 the browser will automatically interrupt downloads of types which could harm your computer if those downloads are started without a user interaction and are not supported by SmartScreen Application Reputation check. Users may override and continue to download by right clicking and choosing “Keep” on the download item.
Enterprise administrators may opt out of this behavior one of these two policies:
    - [ExemptDomainFileTypePairsFromFileTypeDownloadWarnings](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#exemptdomainfiletypepairsfromfiletypedownloadwarnings) - Disable download file type extension-based warnings for specified file types on domains
For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Security downloads interruptions](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-downloads-interruptions)

## Version 90.0.818.8: March 16

### Feature updates

- **Single Sign On (SSO) is now available for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) accounts and Microsoft Account (MSA) on macOS**. A user signed in on Microsoft Edge on macOS will now get automatically signed into websites that are configured to allow single sign on with Work and Microsoft accounts (for example, bing.com, office.com, msn.com, and outlook.com).

- **Kiosk mode.** Starting with Microsoft Edge version 90, we have locked down the UI print settings to only allow the configured printers and “Print to PDF” options. We have also done improvements within the assigned access single app kiosk mode to restrict the launch of other applications from the browser. For more information about the kiosk mode features please go [here](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-configure-kiosk-mode#kiosk-mode-supported-features).

- **Printing:**

  - **New print rasterization mode for non-PostScript printers**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 90, Admins can use a new policy to define print rasterization mode for their users. This policy  controls how Microsoft Edge prints to non-PostScript printers on Windows.  Sometimes print jobs on non-PostScript printers need to be rasterized to print correctly. The print options are Full and Fast.

  - **Additional page scaling options for printing**. Users are now able to customize scaling while printing webpages and PDF documents using additional options. The "Fit to Page" option ensures that the webpage or document is fit into the space available in the selected "Paper size" for printing. The "Actual size" option ensures that there are no changes in the size of the contents being printed regardless of the selected "Paper size".

- **Productivity:**

  - **Autofill suggestions are extended to include address fields content from clipboard**. Clipboard content is parsed when you click on a profile/address field (for example, phone, email, zip code, city, state, etc.) to show as autofill suggestions.

  - **Users can search for autofill suggestions even if a form or field isn’t detected**. Today if you have your information saved on Microsoft Edge, autofill suggestions pop up automatically and help you save time while filling out forms. In cases where autofill misses a form, or if you want to fetch data in forms that don't typically have autofill (like temporary forms), you can search for your information using autofill.

- **Access downloads from a flyout in the menu bar**. Downloads will appear in the top-right corner with all the active downloads in one place. This menu is easily dismissible so users can continue browsing uninterrupted, and they can monitor overall download progress right from the toolbar. [Learn more](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-the-new-downloads-experience/m-p/2111551).
